Vanilla RAG System Overview

This is a sample document to test the Vanilla RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The system allows users to upload documents and chat with them using AI.

Key Features:
1. Document Upload: Support for PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
2. Text Processing: Automatic text extraction and chunking
3. Vector Storage: Documents are stored as embeddings in ChromaDB
4. Chat Interface: Interactive chat with uploaded documents
5. Source Attribution: Responses include references to source documents

Technical Architecture:
- Backend: FastAPI with Python
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
- Vector Database: ChromaDB
- AI Models: OpenAI GPT for chat, OpenAI embeddings for document vectors
- Document Processing: PyPDF2 for PDFs, python-docx for DOCX files

How it works:
1. User uploads a document through the web interface
2. Backend extracts text and splits it into chunks
3. Text chunks are converted to embeddings and stored in ChromaDB
4. When user asks a question, the system:
   - Converts the question to an embedding
   - Finds the most similar document chunks
   - Uses those chunks as context for the AI model
   - Generates a response based on the retrieved information

Benefits:
- Accurate responses based on actual document content
- Source attribution for transparency
- Scalable architecture for multiple documents
- User-friendly interface for document management

This system is particularly useful for:
- Research and analysis
- Document Q&A
- Knowledge base management
- Academic and business applications
